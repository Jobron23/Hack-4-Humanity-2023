## Inspiration
In the past few months, the world has undergone a litany of disasterous events. Situations such as the Ohio train derailment
the recent earthquakes in Turkey, have inspired us to think deeply about common humanitarian issues that arise due to unexpected
crises. Specifically, we took inspiration from the water issues that took place in Flint, Michigan. To give a bit context, in 2014
Flint, Michigan experienced a severe water crisis in which their drinking water was contaminated with lead and Legionella Bacteria.
Our project aims to combat future crises like this on a national scale, enabling citizens all over the U.S. to be able to locate
safe drinking water.
