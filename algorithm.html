This HTML file contains a button element that, when clicked, calls a JavaScript function named displayVariable(). Inside this function, a variable named myVariable is declared and assigned a value. Then, the textContent property of an HTML element with the ID "variable" is set to the value of myVariable, which displays the variable's value on the page.
