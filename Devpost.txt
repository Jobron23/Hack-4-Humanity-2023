## Inspiration
In the past few months, the world has undergone a litany of disasterous events. Situations such as the Ohio train derailment
the recent earthquakes in Turkey, have inspired us to think deeply about common humanitarian issues that arise due to unexpected
crises. Specifically, we took inspiration from the water issues that took place in Flint, Michigan. To give a bit context, in 2014
Flint, Michigan experienced a severe water crisis in which their drinking water was contaminated with lead and Legionella Bacteria.
Our project aims to combat future crises like this on a national scale, enabling citizens all over the U.S. to be able to locate
safe drinking water. 


## What it does
Project Safe Water effectively tracks the location of safe drinking sources in a small vicinity of the users location. When accessing
our website, users are prompted with options to enter in both their state and county. Project Safe Water displays the pH level of the
water, the turbidity, and the amount of the dissolved oxygen in the water based on location. Each of these values is stored, converted
into longitude and latitude, and plotted on a map in which the user can view. Afterwards, the user is provided with safe, clean drinking
water choices in their vicinity

## How we built it



## Challenges we ran into
The first challenge we ran into was git

Turning a county name into a the right code to query the api with

Locating a usable API that returns the location of water fountains
